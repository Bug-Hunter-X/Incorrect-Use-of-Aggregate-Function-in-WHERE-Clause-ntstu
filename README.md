This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: incorrectly using an aggregate function like AVG() within the WHERE clause. The provided SQL query attempts to filter employees based on whether their salary exceeds the average salary of all employees. However, this approach is syntactically incorrect.  The solution shows how to correctly compute the average salary first (using a subquery or CTE) and then filter the employee records based on the calculated average.
